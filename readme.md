## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This site is using a simple template from HTML5 UP. There have been a few modifications to make images fit, and take full advatage of the space on the page and make it a little more mobile friendly while keeping it responsive.


## Examples:
Take a look at a couple of these examples that I have displayed in my portfolio:

**Skincare Lounge:** https://skincarelounge.com/

**BarMate:** https://barmate.bar/

**Yuki's Photography:** https://www.yuhhiphotography.art/
